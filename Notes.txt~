Notes to be implemented in final program
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Set compliance for end-effector poistioning. ------------ done >>>>>>>> Measure value from Windows!!!!!

Measure at what place end effector closes and hold apple (for now, without having much pressure on motor)  >>> Closing stop with respect to force sensor implemented!!!


Measure value of how much more to move after contact >> Integrate this measurement with complaince allowance!!!???????


Reduce Arduino send stop when touched threshold!!!!!???????????



Define proper order in which motors should be called --------- kinda done >> try improving

Rename all motors in order?????????????


Get motor vals for start position and end position (and any path if desired) ---------kinda done >> try improving



add something to read current state of motors and check if reached desired position --------------- done
